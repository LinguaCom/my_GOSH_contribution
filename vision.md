# My Vision 
As a content specialist, translator and an educator with over 20 years of experience of working with formal and informal education systems in Israel, I envision GOSH DAO becoming an alternative for numerous scientists who struggle with
* Bureaucracy
* Inequality (language, status, special needs, health issues)
* Working in an “unpopular” field 
* Working in interdisciplinary fields that fall beyond the financing criteria



At the moment, I am just starting out as a content researcher and specialist at GOSH, and my first steps are going to be as follows:
* Creating a detailed survey targeted at Israeli scientists in different fields (TBD) to pinpoint their needs;
* Creating a survey for graduate students with the purpose of 
* Finding 10-15 volunteers in the academic field who would agree to test the platform;
* Conducting deep interviews with those volunteers to get
1. Suggestions for making the platform more accessible;
2. Content suggestions;
3. Formulate the benefits of the platform for other scientists
* Categorising and labeling existing content to create a stable content flow in the following three categories:
1. Fundamental content that answers the audiences questions about GOSH DAO (articles, presentations)
2. Serial content that contains both entertainment-oriented features and science-related publications
3. Micro-content: SM announcements and communication
Some future goals:
Based on the surveys and interviews as well as on the previously written content, 
* adjust the future content strategy for the Israeli GOSH academic DAO
* create a community of scientists who already use DAO:
* arrange 
1. live meetups (using Meetup platform)
2. Young scientists marathons;
3. Interdisciplinary forums;
4. Open days for schools, colleges and universities to encourage research and entrepreneurship.
